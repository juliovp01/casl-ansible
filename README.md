#  rhc-ose ansible Automation

Automation of OpenShift 3 using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/)

## Provisioning Quickstart

### Local Setup (one time, only)

In addition to _cloning this repo_, you'll need the following:

* Access to an OpenStack environment using an link:http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-set-environment-variables-using-openstack-rc.html[OpenStack RC File]
  * File should be placed at `~/.config/openstack/openrc.sh`
* A link:https://github.com/naturalis/openstack-docs/wiki/Howto:-Creating-and-using-OpenStack-SSH-keypairs-on-Linux-and-OSX[Key-pair created in OpenStack]
* Docker installed (`yum install -y docker` on RHEL/Centos, `dnf install docker -y` on Fedora)
  * If you plan to run docker as yourself (non-root), your username must be added to the `docker` user group.
* An `~/.ansible.cfg` file containing the following:
```
[defaults]
roles_path= /root/repository/rhc-ose/rhc-ose-ansible/roles:/root/repository/openshift-ansible/roles
filter_plugins= /usr/share/ansible_plugins/filter_plugins:/root/repository/openshift-ansible/filter_plugins
host_key_checking = False
```
* Clone this, and dependent `openshift-ansible` repositories into the same directory
```
cd ~/src/
git clone git@github.com:redhat-cop/casl-ansible.git
git clone git@github.com:openshift/openshift-ansible.git
```
* Copy `casl-ansible/inventory/sample.casl.example.com.d/inventory/clouds.yaml` to `~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml`

Cool! Now you're ready to provision OpenShift clusters

### Provision a Cluster

To start, we'll provision a the `sample.casl.example.com` cluster defined in the `casl-ansible/inventory` directory.

1. Edit `casl-ansible/inventory/sample.casl.example.com/hosts` and edit the `# OpenStack Provisioning Variables` and `# Subscription Management` sections at the top to match your environment/project/tenant.
2. Start the `openstack-client` container.
```
./casl-ansible/docker/openstack-client-centos/run.sh --repository=/path/to/repos/dir/
```
3. Run the `end-to-end` provisioning playbook
```
ansible-playbook -i /root/repository/casl-ansible/inventory/sample.casl.example.com.d/inventory /root/repository/casl-ansible/playbooks/openshift/end-to-end.yml
```

## Roles

The following are a list of Absible roles available

* cicd - Installs and configures CICD tools such as Jenkins and Nexus
* cicd-common - Sets common CICD related facts
* common - Provides for the generation of an environment id per execution and sets common facts
* openshift-common - Sets common OpenShift related facts
* openshift-provision - Installs and configures OpenShift on a set of masters and nodes (Work in Progress)
* openstack-create - Creates an OpenStack instances and attaches block storage

## Playbooks

The following are a list of Ansible playbooks

* OpenShift Provision (ose-provision.yml)
    * Provision machines on OpenStack for OpenShift
	    * Attach persistent storage
	    * Update machines with latest packages
        * Additional work in progress
* Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (cicd-provision.yml)
	* Provision instance on OpenStack
		* Attach persistent storage
	* Install prerequisite packages
	* Install and configure Java, Groovy, Maven, Jenkins, Nexus, Docker


## Provisioning an OpenShift Environment

### Prerequisites

A client environment with the appropriate entitlements to Red Hat Enterprise 7 and OpenShift Enterprise 3 is required to provision new OpenShift environments. A [host builder docker image](../docker/openshift-host-builder) is available to provide an execution environment.

### Configuring the Inventory

The current supported method of provisioning new OpenShift environments is to utilize OpenStack. The `openstack_key_name` in the `ose3` inventory file at the root of this folder must have the SSH key name specified in order for Ansible to be able to communicate with the newly provisioned machines

### Running the OpenShift Playbook

Execute the following command to run the playbook

    ansible-playbook -i inventory/ose-provision ose-provision.yml


### Running the CICD Playbook

Execute the following command to run the playbook

    ansible-playbook -i inventory/cicd-provision cicd-provision.yml
